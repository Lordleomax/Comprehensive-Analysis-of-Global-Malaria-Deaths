![World Malaria Deaths](https://github.com/Lordleomax/World-Malaria-Deaths/assets/131598329/aa93186c-3adf-4b60-8204-dec47e74b6e1)

This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive overview of global malaria deaths on three distinct levels.

1: Country-specific Malaria Deaths

2: Continental Breakdown of Malaria Deaths

3: Time Series Analysis of Malaria Deaths (2000-2019)

## Methodology
This methodology provided a structured approach to analyze and synthesize data on global malaria deaths, ultimately offering valuable insights for public health efforts and interventions.

 Data Collection: Time series data on malaria deaths spanning from 2000 to 2019 was gathered from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/malaria) . The dataset enabled the examination of temporal trends in malaria mortality.
 
Data Validation: The dataset was cross-referenced with reliable sources to ensure accuracy. Any discrepancies were addressed before further analysis.

Data Cleaning: The dataset was carefully reviewed to ensure data integrity. Any anomalies, missing values, or outliers were addressed through appropriate data cleaning techniques.

Country-level Analysis: The dataset was analyzed on a country-by-country basis to identify countries with the highest and lowest malaria-related death counts.


Noteworthy trends, such as countries reporting zero deaths, were highlighted to understand variations in malaria mortality.


 Key observations were identified, including disparities in regional impacts, progress over time, and areas necessitating continued focus.


## Insights From Comprehensive Analysis of Global Malaria Deaths (2000-2019)

1. Country-specific Malaria Deaths (2000-2019):

   - Over the two-decade period, a total of 166,459,190 (166.459 million) malaria-related deaths were reported globally.

   - In 2004, there was a peak in malaria deaths, with approximately 960,800 (0.961 million) fatalities. This represents 0.58% of the total deaths in that year.

   - By 2019, the number of malaria deaths had decreased to 643,200 (0.643 million), accounting for 0.29% of the total deaths in that year.

   - Notably, Nigeria consistently reported the highest number of malaria deaths, with 4,610,044 (4.61 million) deaths in total over the period, representing 2.77% of the global total.

2. Continental Breakdown of Malaria Deaths (2000-2019):

   - Africa experienced the highest burden of malaria deaths, accounting for 14,946,000 (14.946 million) deaths, or 89.7% of the global total. This is consistent with Africa's status as the most affected continent by malaria.

   - Asia followed with 1,623,500 (1.6235 million) deaths, making up 9.77% of the global total.

   - Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America collectively reported 42,500 (0.0425 million) deaths, contributing only 0.03% to the global total.

3. Temporal Trends in Malaria Deaths:

   - The analysis of the time series data revealed a declining trend in malaria deaths over the two decades. In 2000, there were 882,100 (0.8821 million) deaths, representing 0.53% of total deaths that year.

   - In 2019, this number had reduced to 643,200 (0.643 million) deaths, comprising 0.29% of the total deaths that year.

   - This trend indicates progress in global efforts to combat malaria, with a 27% reduction in deaths from 2000 to 2019.

## Recommendations and Implications:

1. The analysis underscores the continued need for targeted interventions in regions heavily affected by malaria, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

2. Efforts should be sustained to further reduce mortality rates and work towards the ultimate goal of malaria elimination.

3. International collaboration and resource allocation should focus on regions with the highest burden of malaria deaths.

## Limitations:

1. The analysis is based on available data up to September 2021 and may not reflect the most current situation. Newer data may provide additional insights.

2. Variations in reporting practices and data accuracy between countries and regions may impact the interpretation of the numbers.
